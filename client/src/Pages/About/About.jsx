          underprivileged and marginalized. Founded by the trio of Pravesh,
          Akhilesh, and Neelam, driven by a shared passion for social justice,

          While nascent in its years, Shyam Trust draws inspiration from
          established organizations like Samarthanam, learning from their
          extensive experience and tailoring their approach to the specific
          needs of the Bhiwadi community. Just as Samarthanam champions the
          cause of inclusivity for persons with disabilities, Shyam Trust
          aspires to bridge the gap for the underprivileged in Bhiwadi,
          irrespective of their background or limitations.
